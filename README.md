# PublicationLibrary
This program manages the information of publications. It adds the research areas, publication venues, conference and journal papers, the references cited in those conference and journal papers and the publishers/organizers of the publication venue. The program then retrieves the information from the library such as getting the publication information of a journal or a conference paper. This program also converts the citations cited in a publication to the IEEE references format.
